# Chain / Wallet Security Audit Plan (2026-05-28)

## Scope

This audit covers the chain and wallet security boundary across:

- `zero-chain`
- `zero-wallet-chrome`
- `zero-wallet-mobile`

Out of scope for this pass:

- `zero-chain-site` marketing website
- `zero-explorer` UI/API internals, except where wallet or chain trust assumptions depend on it
- `zero-mining-stack`, except where chain RPC write-auth behavior affects mining submissions

## Audit Method

Each item is checked with:

- source review of the relevant code path
- existing test review
- targeted static searches for dangerous patterns
- targeted test/build execution where useful

Severity:

- `Critical`: direct key theft, forged chain state, arbitrary transaction signing, or unauthenticated state mutation with realistic exploitation path
- `High`: replay, network confusion, signer bypass, secret disclosure, persistent compromise, or unsafe default affecting mainnet
- `Medium`: hardening gap, missing validation, weak UX guardrail, or narrow abuse path
- `Low`: documentation, observability, or defense-in-depth gap

Status:

- `Planned`
- `Checking`
- `Pass`
- `Finding`
- `Blocked`

## Checklist

| ID | Area | Check | Repos | Status | Result |

## Findings

### F-01 High - Fixed - Compute network binding was incomplete on preflight/signing paths

`zero_submitComputeTx` already rejected chain/network mismatches, but `zero_simulateComputeTx`
and wallet signing paths could still accept or fill transaction data without first binding it to
the selected network.

Fixed:

- `zero_simulateComputeTx` now calls the same `validate_compute_tx_network` path as submit.
- Chrome wallet binds `chain_id` and `network_id` from the selected network before signing and
  rejects mismatched explicit IDs.
- Mobile wallet does the same before local signing.

Evidence:

- `zero-chain/crates/zeroapi/src/rpc/mod.rs`: `zero_simulate_compute_tx`,
  `zero_submit_compute_tx`, `validate_compute_tx_network`
- `zero-wallet-chrome/src/background/index.ts`: `bindComputeTxToNetwork`
- `zero-wallet-mobile/lib/presentation/providers/wallet_provider.dart`:
  `bindComputeTxToNetwork`
- Tests: `test_zero_simulate_compute_tx_rejects_network_mismatch`,
  `test_zero_submit_compute_tx_rejects_network_mismatch`,
  Chrome `does not auto-switch networks for simulateComputeTx`,
  mobile `rejects wrong-network compute transactions before signing`

### F-02 Medium - Fixed - CLI wallet/session files were not forced to owner-only mode

Wallet and unlock-session files contain encrypted key material or session material. They are now
written through a single `write_secret_file` helper that creates new Unix files with mode `0600`,
tightens existing file permissions before writing, and syncs the file.

Evidence:

- `zero-chain/crates/zerocli/src/commands/wallet.rs`: `write_secret_file`
- Test: `saved_secret_files_are_owner_only`

### F-03 Low - Fixed - Chrome extension declared unused page-injection permissions

`activeTab` and `scripting` were declared but no `chrome.scripting` or page injection path is used.
The permissions were removed to reduce blast radius if the extension is compromised.

Evidence:

- `zero-wallet-chrome/manifest.json`
- Static search: no `chrome.scripting`, `content_scripts`, `onMessageExternal`, or
  `externally_connectable` entries

### F-04 High - Open - Rust dependency audit reports vulnerable transitive crates

`cargo audit` reports two vulnerability findings:

- `hickory-proto 0.24.4` via `libp2p-mdns 0.45.1`:
  `RUSTSEC-2026-0119`, CPU exhaustion during message encoding, fixed in `>=0.26.1`.
- `protobuf 2.28.0` via `prometheus 0.13.4`:
  `RUSTSEC-2024-0437`, uncontrolled recursion crash, fixed in `>=3.7.2`.

There are also unmaintained/unsound warnings for `bincode`, `core2`, `fxhash`, `instant`, `paste`,
`rustls-pemfile`, `lru`, and `rand`.

Recommended follow-up:

- Upgrade or replace the affected libp2p/hickory and prometheus/protobuf dependency paths in a
  dedicated compatibility branch.
- Re-run full chain, P2P, mining, RocksDb, and mainnet topology smoke tests after dependency
  changes.

### F-05 High - Open - Chrome dependency audit reports build/test supply-chain issues

`bun audit` reports 20 vulnerabilities: 8 high and 12 moderate. High findings include `undici`,
`rollup`, `flatted`, and `picomatch`; moderate findings include `postcss`, `vite`, `ws`, `yaml`,
`esbuild`, `brace-expansion`, and additional `picomatch` advisories.

Most affected paths are build/test/dev tooling, but they still matter for release integrity and CI
runner safety.

Recommended follow-up:

- Refresh `bun.lock` with compatible upgrades first.
- If compatible upgrades cannot clear high findings, plan the Vite/CRX plugin/test-tooling major
  upgrade separately.
- Re-run extension unit tests and production build after lockfile changes.

### F-06 Medium - Open - Strict mainnet RPC write auth needs wallet delivery design

The node now enforces token-protected stateful write methods. Chrome and mobile wallets do not
currently have an RPC auth-token configuration path, so direct submission to a strict mainnet node
will fail unless an authenticated gateway/proxy is used.

Security note:

- Do not simply embed a shared mainnet token in wallet builds.
- Prefer per-user/session gateway authorization, or a wallet setting that stores endpoint-specific
  tokens in encrypted/platform storage with clear UX warnings.

### F-07 Blocked - Mobile formatter/tests could not run in this environment

`dart` and `flutter` are not installed in this workspace environment, so mobile `dart format` and
Flutter tests could not be executed here. Source review and static searches were completed, and
new tests were added, but runtime verification is still pending on a Flutter-enabled runner.

## Checklist Results

| ID | Status | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| C1 | Pass | Stateful write RPC methods require token configuration; rate limiting uses `remote_addr.ip()` and does not trust `x-forwarded-for`. |
| C2 | Pass | `zero_importBlock` rejects legacy transactions, stale/parent mismatch, invalid header hash, invalid parent/header relation, invalid difficulty, invalid mix hash, and insufficient PoW. |
| C3 | Pass / Fixed | Submit and simulate both require tx chain/network IDs to match node config; wallets bind IDs before signing. |
| C4 | Pass | Chain, Chrome, and mobile compute signing use `ZEROCHAIN-COMPUTE-SIGNING-V1`; shared fixtures keep canonical tx ID parity. |
| C5 | Pass / Fixed | CLI wallet/session writes are owner-only on Unix; no direct private-key logging found in targeted scans. |
| W1 | Pass | Chrome vault stores private keys encrypted in `chrome.storage.local` using PBKDF2-SHA256 and AES-GCM; public account responses omit `privateKey`. |
| W2 | Pass / Fixed | Chrome compute simulate/submit no longer auto-switches RPC networks and binds tx IDs to selected network before signing. |
| W3 | Pass / Fixed | Page bridge is removed, no external message bridge was found, and unused page-injection permissions were removed. |
| W4 | Pass | Mobile stores wallet accounts in `FlutterSecureStorage`; private keys are encrypted with PBKDF2-SHA256 and AES-GCM before storage. |
| W5 | Pass / Fixed | Mobile custom RPC accepts HTTPS or local HTTP only; compute signing now binds selected chain/network IDs. |
| W6 | Pass / Fixed | Mobile provider rejects non-object/mismatched compute tx inputs before signing. |
| X1 | Pass | Cross-project fixture parity verified by Rust and Chrome tests; mobile uses the same signing domain string. |
| X2 | Finding | No committed secrets found in targeted scans, but Rust and Chrome dependency audits have open high-risk findings. |
| M1 | Pass | `mainnet.sh` bootnode/follower/observer topology started successfully with mainnet IDs, RocksDb files, default rate limit/difficulty, and RPC auth enabled. |

  Bootnode RocksDb directory contained `CURRENT`, `MANIFEST`, `OPTIONS`, `LOG`, `LOCK`, and
  `IDENTITY` files.
  Unauthenticated `zero_submitWork` and `zero_importBlock` returned `Unauthorized`.
  All three mainnet smoke nodes were stopped after verification.
