# ZeroChain Storage Architecture

This document defines the storage direction for ZeroChain nodes after the initial RocksDB/Redb
compute store implementation.

## Goals

- Keep consensus and UTXO Compute validation on low-latency key-value storage.
- Reduce hot node disk footprint without making random output lookups expensive.
- Move historical scan/analytics workloads out of the consensus hot path.
- Preserve forward-compatible on-disk codecs so nodes can read older local databases.

## Data Tiers

### Hot State Tier

Hot state is required to validate new blocks and compute transactions.

- Backend: RocksDB for production, Redb for portable/local testing, Mem for tests.
- Access pattern: point lookups by `OutputId`, latest output lookup by `ObjectId`, small writes per transaction.
- Format: versioned compact binary values.
- Compression: RocksDB ZSTD by default.
- Retention: live outputs and recent state needed for rollback/reorg windows.

The hot tier must not use Parquet/ORC-style columnar files because validation needs random lookups
and atomic updates. Columnar files are optimized for scans, not UTXO point reads.

### Historical Archive Tier

Historical archive data is not needed for immediate validation after finalization.

- Data: old blocks, spent outputs, old compute results, historical receipts, explorer operation rows.
- Format: `archive-<from>-<to>.zst` segment files by height range.
- Access pattern: append by segment, fetch by height/hash, rare reindex.
- Retention: configurable per node profile.

Archive data can be pruned on ordinary full nodes and retained on archive/explorer nodes.

### Columnar Analytics Tier

Columnar storage belongs to explorer and analytics workloads.

- Data: address histories, operation lists, block summaries, compute result summaries.
- Format: Parquet/Arrow-style schema outside the consensus hot DB.
- Compression: ZSTD with dictionary/statistics when enough samples exist.
- Access pattern: scans, filters, aggregations.

This tier is rebuildable from archive/hot data. It must not be a source of consensus truth.

## Current Implementation Step

The first code step changes compute outputs and compute tx results from JSON values to versioned
binary values:

```text
key   = "compute:output:" || output_id
value = "ZCO1" || bincode(ObjectOutput)

key   = "compute:txresult:" || tx_id
value = "ZCR1" || bincode(ComputeResultEnvelope)
```

Readers keep JSON fallback support so existing development databases remain readable. New writes use
binary. This removes repeated JSON field names and decimal byte-array formatting, which are the
largest avoidable overhead in the current compute store.

## Expected Savings

The practical savings are workload-dependent:

- JSON compute outputs and tx results to binary values: roughly 30-50% smaller for output-heavy workloads.
- RocksDB LZ4 to ZSTD: usually lower disk usage, with higher CPU cost.
- Hot state plus pruning/snapshots: 70-95% smaller than archive-style full history nodes.
- Columnar analytics: strong savings for scans and repeated fields, but not for hashes/signatures.

Hash-like fields (`OutputId`, `TxId`, block hashes, signatures, public keys) are high entropy and do
not compress much. Major gains come from avoiding JSON overhead, pruning history, and separating
analytics data from validation data.

## Node Profiles

### Full Validator

- Keeps hot state and recent rollback window.
- Uses RocksDB ZSTD and binary compute output values.
- Prunes old spent compute outputs and old compute tx results outside the configured rollback window.

### Archive Node

- Keeps hot state plus historical archive segments.
- May store block/compute history in compressed segment files.
- Can rebuild columnar analytics exports.

### Explorer Node

- Reads RPC/archive feeds.
- Builds columnar analytics tables for address, block, and compute browsing.
- Does not participate in consensus validation from columnar data.

## Migration Rules

- On-disk values must carry a codec magic/version prefix when they are not legacy JSON.
- Readers should support at least the previous production codec during development.
- New writers may use the latest codec immediately if the reader is backward compatible.
- Destructive rewrites or pruning need an explicit operator command and a rollback plan.

Compute DB rebuilds are explicit operator actions. They rewrite output values through the current
codec and recreate file-based backends with the active backend options, including RocksDB ZSTD:

```bash
zerochain --network mainnet storage rebuild-compute-db
zerochain --network mainnet storage rebuild-compute-db --dry-run
zerochain storage rebuild-compute-db \
  --compute-backend rocksdb \
  --compute-db-path ./data/compute-db
```

The node must be stopped before running a rebuild; file-based backends take an exclusive database
lock and the command intentionally refuses unsafe in-memory rebuilds.

The command writes a new database at `<path>.rebuild-<timestamp>`, moves the old database to
`<path>.backup-<timestamp>`, then installs the rebuilt database at the original path. Keep the backup
until the node has restarted and caught up successfully; pass `--discard-backup` only for disposable
development databases.

`--dry-run` scans the source, builds and verifies a temporary rebuilt database, then deletes the
temporary database without replacing the original path. The command checks source scan count,
rebuilt target count, and installed count during real rebuilds. If an error interrupts the rebuild,
the error message names any temporary or backup path that needs inspection or cleanup before retrying.

Compute hot-state pruning is also explicit:

```bash
zerochain --network mainnet storage prune-compute-db --dry-run
zerochain --network mainnet storage prune-compute-db \
  --retention-profile full \
  --retention-window-secs 604800
zerochain storage prune-compute-db \
  --compute-backend rocksdb \
  --compute-db-path ./data/compute-db \
  --retention-profile archive
```

`full`, `validator`, and `mainnet` profiles prune old spent outputs and old tx results outside the
window. `archive`, `explorer`, and `retain-all` scan but keep all entries. Pruning never deletes
unspent outputs. If a pruned spent output is still referenced by `compute:latest`, the stale latest
pointer is removed with it.

Archive segments are consensus-external files. The storage layer writes `ZAS1` segment envelopes
compressed with ZSTD. A segment contains finalized block wrappers, historical compute outputs, and
historical compute tx results for an inclusive height range. The wrapper stores canonical block hash
and height separately because `BlockHeader.hash` is skipped by normal block serialization.

Disk savings reports are generated from a fixed synthetic workload:

```bash
zerochain storage benchmark-compute-db \
  --outputs 10000 \
  --queries 2000 \
  --overwrite
```

The report compares legacy JSON with RocksDB LZ4, current binary RocksDB ZSTD, binary ZSTD after
pruning, and ZSTD archive segments. It writes Markdown to `docs/STORAGE_SAVINGS_REPORT.md` by
default and uses `artifacts/storage-savings-workload` for generated databases.

## Next Steps

- Wire finalized block/compute export from node execution into `ArchiveSegmentWriter`.
- Add rebuildable Parquet/Arrow export for explorer analytics.
